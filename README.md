# call-center
Project to implement a simulated telephony application using Python + Twisted.

## Basic implementation
Implement a call center queue application that manages a set of call center operators and
delivers received calls to be "answered" by them.

## Advanced implementation
Extend the basic implementation by splitting it in two processes that work together by
communicating via network in a client-server architecture.
